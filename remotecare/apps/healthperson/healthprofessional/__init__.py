Remote Care allows healthprofessionals to automate the periodically control
of a chronic patient. The process includes adding new patients and
configuring the period used for control and which questionnaires should be
used.

When a patient has filled in the questionnaires for a control, the
healthprofessional can login and view the information filled in. The
control can be finished by editing an automatic generated report and
message and clicking the 'finish' button. After this step
the message is sent to the patient and the report can be
exported in docX or PDF.
