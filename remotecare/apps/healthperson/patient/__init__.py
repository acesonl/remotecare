Remote Care allows chronic patients to digitalize their periodic
checkups/controls by filling in questionnaires and providing optional
extra information.

Patients are automatically informed when they need to fill in questionnaires.
The results of previous filled in questionnaires can be viewed and the patient
can read messages sent by an healthprofessional.

When the patient is feeling ill (but no emergency) the 'urgent control'
questionnaires can be filled in advance of planning an appointment with
the healthprofessional.

The information section shows disease specific information to the patient.
