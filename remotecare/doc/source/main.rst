Remote Care is designed with the aim to automate the regular control of a
patient with a chronic disease. Since such diseases can have long periods
of low activity the patient might not need a regular (face to face) control
appointment when he/she has no complications. Instead the patient could fill
in some questionnaires and if necessary plan an e-consult.

:subtitle:`Functional design:`
The functional design of Remote Care has been created in Google docs. Ask
an ExampleInc employee for access to the functional design if necessary.

:subtitle:`Technical design:`
There is a small technical design document in Google docs. But as a strategy
most information is included into this documentation and comments in the code
since separate documents tend not to be used.
