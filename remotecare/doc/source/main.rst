Remotecare is designed with the aim to automate the regular control of a
patient with a chronic disease. Since such diseases can have long periods
of low activity the patient might not need a regular (face to face) control
appointment when he/she has no complications. Instead the patient could fill
in some questionnaires and if necessary plan an e-consult.
